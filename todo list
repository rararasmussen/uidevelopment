- look at using BEM naming convention for css classes
- look at just using an image for the main banner on home page? vs using tile + image, what are the benefits
- work out nav & make nav-related class names more clear
- change console card images

functionality:
- adding and removing from shopping cart must work
- incrementing
- adding correct # of items to cart must work
- typing in search works - but can just have a fixed result page
- filters don't need to work
- drop downs should work - need to be able to see options and select
- forms should validate, but can just have a random fixed response
- checkout total can be fixed
- little terms and conditions check box can work
- all product tiles should link somewhere, so just to the two ones we picked
- details, shipping, FAQ should work & drop down
- nav bar drop down should work
- add a little notification dot to cart when there's something in it

pages still to be added:
- pop ups for added to cart **I can do this (thomas)
- order confirmation (could keep as pop up or just make it its own page if simpler)
- xbox page -> search results page, just need to change header


Tom:
- Report template from A2 New Figma File

- make grid at top of halo page resizable so that the details drop down below the image when screen gets narrower (there's also an issue where it starts to run into the shipping/faq because it doesn't bump them down)

- maybe instead of having an arrow to go to other product photo we put both of the product photos in the image container - there's plenty of space

Annika:
- finish xbox page - thing at bottom to show next/prev page
- make some sort of hover class for buttons, divs, etc that get bigger & have drop shadow when hovered on - hoverable? not super important rn
- drop down for FAQ, details, shipping
- T&C check box on shopping cart - do later since it requires making all the rules for a custom checkbox
- figure out the nightmare that is the shipping table
